This is a threaded chat made in by Lorenzo Del Forno and Andrea Mauro.
This is actually a fork of https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-server-client-implementation-in-c/
but with several improvements such as threading and a better UI

Mind to run the server first, and close all clients before shutting down the server

to compile just run compile.sh
